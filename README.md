<h1>Underwater Object Classification Using Logistic Regression</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
Project Overview:
In this project, we aim to support a country’s submarine navigation system in detecting and differentiating between underwater threats and obstacles. Enemy forces have deployed naval mines beneath the ocean surface—these explosive devices are triggered upon contact. Additionally, natural formations such as rocks are also present underwater, posing navigational challenges. To ensure safe navigation, the submarine must accurately identify whether an object beneath it is a mine or a rock.

Problem Statement:
We are developing a machine learning model capable of classifying sonar signals to determine whether the detected object is a mine or a rock. The submarine emits sonar pulses, and the returned signal data (sonar readings) serve as input features for the predictive model.

Model Approach:
This is a binary classification problem, as the target variable has two possible outcomes: Rock or Mine. We utilize the Logistic Regression algorithm for this task, as it is well-suited for binary classification scenarios due to its interpretability, efficiency, and performance on linearly separable datasets.
